                                to certain features that may be of interest to you, we may require personal information.

                                descriptions), because if you do then it will then become public information. You always

                                by other parties. Some of these other websites contain our brand names and trademarks
                                and other intellectual property that we own; others do not. When you click on these
                                links and visit these other websites, regardless of whether or not they contain our
                                brand names, trademarks and other intellectual property, you need to be aware that we do

                                ways than we would if it were collected on the ORGANO website. This concept also applies
                                to your disclosure of information to any other parties. We encourage you to review their
                                privacy policies and remind you that we will not be responsible for their actions.</p>

                                services that might be of interest. These types of communications are
                                known as "Operational Communications". In some cases, Operational Communications may
                                also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads

                                those contained in Operational Communications). Some
                                of these options may only be for a certain category of communications; others may be
                                more general. If you wish to stop receiving certain
                                communications, you have the option to do so by changing your user preferences.</p>

                                transactions and supporting your activities, it may be necessary for us to share
                                your personal information with our internal agents, representatives, contractors and
                                service providers so they can provide us with support services
                                such as authorization of credit card transactions, billing, affiliate programs, email
                                origination, receipt or support services, customer relationship
                                management services, order fulfilment and promotional fulfilment. We require these

                                own privacy policies, over which we have no control, and you
                                agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Those

                                to our internal service providers as we determine is necessary to support and process
                                your activities and transactions, as well as to your debit or
                                credit card issuer for their purposes. These third parties may include the debit or

                                submit financial information in order to use them, you also consent to our providing
                                your financial information to those third parties.</p>
                            <h3>Special Cases in which we share Personal and Financial Information</h3>
                            <p class="mb-75">We may disclose personal information or financial information when we
                                determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with applicable law,
                                to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of ORGANO, its
                                Independent Distribution Partners, or other visitors to the
                                ORGANO website. Whenever personal information or financial information is disclosed
                                under this paragraph, we may also disclose your
                                demographic information along with it, on a non-anonymous basis.</p>
                            <p class="mb-75">ORGANO will cooperate with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other
                                third parties in the interest of enforcing laws, preventing criminal activity,
                                protecting rights (including intellectual property), and protecting you and our ORGANO
                                community from harmful or criminal acts. Therefore, if we
                                receive a verified request by government officials or other law enforcement agencies
                                regarding an alleged illegal activity or investigation, you
                                authorize us to disclose any of your personal information or history without a subpoena.
                                In an effort to respect your privacy however, we will not
                                otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government
                                officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially
                                similar legal procedure, unless we believe that such information is necessary to prevent
                                imminent physical harm or financial loss, or to report
                                suspected illegal activity. You also authorize us to disclose your personal and account
                                information under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole
                                discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of
                                fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful
                                activity.</p>
