                        <h3>Pricing</h3>
                        <p class="mb-35">Prices listed on this website reflect the current prices of the products in the USA. Currency for all products on OrganoGold.com is in United States Dollars (USD). Except where noted otherwise, the List Price displayed for products on our website represents the wholesale price for Independent Distributors or, if you are a Retail Customer, the retail price listed on the product itself, suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, or estimated in accordance with standard industry practice; or the estimated retail value for a comparably featured item offered elsewhere. The List Price is a comparative price estimate and may or may not represent the prevailing price in every area on any particular day. For certain items that are offered as a set, the List Price may represent “open-stock” prices, which means the aggregate of the manufacturer’s estimated or suggested retail price for each of the items included in the set. Where an item is offered for sale by one of our merchants, the List Price may be provided by the merchant.</p>
                        <p class="mb-75">With respect to items sold by Organo, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order; however, we do NOT charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If an item’s correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Please note that this policy applies only to products sold and shipped by Organo. Your purchases from third-party sellers are charged at the time you place your order, and third-party sellers may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.</p>
                        <h3>Shipping Policy</h3>
                        <p class="mb-75">All products are considered to be “In Stock”. All orders containing only “In Stock” products are to be processed and shipped out within two business days. Flat rate shipping within North America takes 7 – 10 business days. All other forms of shipping are via UPS (United Parcel Service Inc.) and vary according to client selection.</p>
                        <h3>Return/Refund-Buy Back Policy</h3>
                        <p class="mb-75">The goal of Organo is to ensure that Customers are completely satisfied with their purchases. Upon receipt of any package, it should be examined closely prior to opening the factory-sealed products’ packaging. If the order is not in satisfactory, it may be returned provided that the following guidelines are observed:</p>
                        <ul class="mb-75">
                            <li>Returns for “refund” are accepted by the Company only if submitted within 30 days from the order shipment date. Returns of product for the purposes of “exchange” for other product, are accepted by the Company if submitted within 45 days from the order shipment date. Returns submitted to Organo after 45 days will only be processed at the discretion of the Company. If there is any concern about return timelines, the Customer is encouraged to contact the Company directly as soon as possible.</li>
                            <li>All products returned (other than for determination of Defects, as outlined below), must be returned unused, unopened and in resalable condition.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class="mb-75">Defective Products: Organo strives for completely satisfaction of everything offered. This begins from the website all the way to the product selected. That said, “product defects” are carefully scrutinized by Organo. Any product which is suspected to be “defective” should be immediately returned to Organo (Please, refer to section B for return procedures) so that Quality Control can examine the product to verify the nature of the defect and recall similar products from similar lot or batch numbers. When a product determined by Organo to be defective, or otherwise not consistent with Quality Control standards, the Company will immediately replace the product or refund the purchase price. Please DO NOT use the product. Any used or partially used product automatically voids any potential product return.</p>
                        <p class="mb-75"><strong>NOTE:</strong> Any products returned that do not conform to these guidelines will be sent back to the Customer at their sole expense. Remember, all returns must be submitted within the timelines established above. Returns submitted beyond these timelines will only be processed at the discretion of Organo.</p>
                        <ul class="number mb-75">
